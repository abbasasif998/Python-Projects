# Snake and Apple Game

Building snake and apple game in `pygame` and `python`.

Snake and apple is a simple game where when snake eats an apple it gets longer and your score increases. If you snake hits any part of its body or any of the boundries it will die and game will be over with a option or quitting or replaying again.
The Speed of the Snake can be easily changed to increase the difficulty.
